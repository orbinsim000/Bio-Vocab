# Characteristics of life
## Cell
>Basic unit of life.

Cells are what every living thing on Earth is made of, and are made up of smaller parts that aren't alive, however a cell is alive.

![alt text](cell.jfif "cell")

**Is a cell considered an organism?**

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
No, but they make up organisms.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle") 
Yes, but they aren't fully alive.

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closed circle")
It depends, there are single celled organisms and there are multi celled organisms.


## Organism
>Any individual living thing.

Organisms are what cells make up, and are living beings

![alt text](organism.jfif "organism")

**What do organisms do? Check all that apply.**

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
They reproduce

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
They maintain homeostasis.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
They can live without any energy.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
They create new organisms from nothing with asexual reporduction.

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
They grow and develop.


## Response to Environment
>"stimulus": Something that causes a physiological response. (so, response to environment/stimulus would be "having a physiological response to a stimulus")

When an organism changes its behaviour because of a stimulus.

![alt text](scared.jfif "scared")

**Which one is a response to a stimulus?**

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
Hair breezing in the wind.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
An organism digesting food.

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
A dog barking when the doorbell rings.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
A person sitting down.


## Growth
>(since the textbook doesn't have a definition for this, here's the dictionary definition) The act or process, or a manner of growing.

An organism increasing in size.

![alt text](growth.jfif "growth")

**Is growth the same thing as development?**

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
Yes

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
No


## Development
>(since development is also not listed in the textbook, here's a dictionary definition) The act or process of developing.

An organism permanently changing the way it works and processes information.

![alt text](development.jfif "development")

**Which one is _NOT_ a development?**

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")

A maggot turning into a fly.

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
A tree growing ever so slowly.


## Metabolism
>All chemical processes that synthesize or break down materials within an organism.

The process of obtaining energy from food/fuel.

![alt text](metabolism.jfif "metabolism")

**Is metabolism connected through homeostasis?**

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
Yes, you must create enough energy to sustain homeostasis.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
No, homeostasis is not connected to metabolism.


## Reproduction
>(once again, the textbook doesn't have a definition, so here's another dictionary definition) The natural process among organisms by which new individuals are generated and the species perpetuated(biology definition).

The creation of new organisms through cell division or transfer of sperm to eggs.

![alt text](reproduction.jfif "reproduction")

**Which one is an example of reproduction?**

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
Eating food and having it turn into waste.

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
Planting a tree and watching it grow.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
Adopting a child.


## Homeostasis
>Regulation and maintenance of constant internal conditions in an organism.

Maintaining suitable conditions inside an organism for it to live properly.

![alt text](homeostasis.jfif "homeostasis")

**Which one is _NOT_ related to homeostasis?**

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
