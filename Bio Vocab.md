# Characteristics of life
## Cell
>

Cells are what every living thing on Earth is made of, and are made up of smaller parts that aren't alive, however a cell is alive.

![alt text](cell.jfif "cell")

**Is a cell considered an organism?**

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
No, but they make up organisms.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle") 
Yes, but they aren't fully alive.

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closed circle")
It depends, there are single celled organisms and there are multi celled organisms.


## Organism
>

Organisms are what cells make up, and are living beings

![alt text](organism.jfif "organism")

**What do organisms do? Check all that apply.**

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
They reproduce

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
They maintain homeostasis.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
They can live without any energy.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
They create new organisms from nothing with asexual reporduction.

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
They grow and develop.


## Response to Environment
>

When an organism changes its behaviour because of a stimulus.

![alt text](scared.jfif "scared")

**Which one is a response to a stimulus?**

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
Hair breezing in the wind.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
An organism digesting food.

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
A dog barking when the doorbell rings.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
A person sitting down.


## Growth
>

An organism increasing in size.

![alt text](growth.jfif "growth")

**Is growth the same thing as development?**

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
Yes

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
No


## Development
>

An organism permanently changing the way it works and processes information.

![alt text](development.jfif "development")

**Which one is _NOT_ a development?**

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
A catipiller turning into a butterfly.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
A baby in its mother's womb.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
A maggot turning into a fly.

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
A tree growing ever so slowly.


## Metabolism
>

Obtaining energy from cellular respiration.

![alt text](metabolism.jfif "metabolism")

**Is metabolism connected through homeostasis?**

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
Yes, you must create enough energy to sustain homeostasis.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
No, homeostasis is not connected to metabolism.


## Reproduction
>

The creation of new organisms through cell division or transfer of sperm to eggs.

![alt text](reproduction.jfif "reproduction")

**Which one is an example of reproduction?**

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
Eating food and having it turn into waste.

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
Planting a tree and watching it grow.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
Adopting a child.


## Homeostasis
>

Maintaining suitable conditions inside an organism for it to live properly.

![alt text](homeostasis.jfif "homeostasis")

**Which one is _NOT_ related to homeostasis?**

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
