## Cell Theory
>Theory that states that all organisms are made of cells, all cells are produced by other living cells, and the cell is the most basic unit of life.

The theory that states all living things have cells, all cells come from other cells, and that cells are the most basic form of life.

Cell theory contains everything known about cells.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
Cell theory doesn't contain everything known about cells, in fact all of it is incorrect.

![alt text](eukaryote.jpeg "eukaryote")

**Is a eukaryotic cell able to reproduce asexually?**

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
No, they must reproduce sexually.

![alt text](opencircle.png "closedcircle")
They can, by splitting the nucleus in two and splitting itself in half.

![alt text](closedcircle.png "closedcircle")
They can, by forming another one of itself out of thin air.

![alt text](opencircle.png "opencircle")
They can't, because they have a nucleus.
