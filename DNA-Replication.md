## Double Helix
>A conformation or shape describing a structure that typically consists of two matching helices intertwined about a common axis, such as the structure of the DNA molecule, which is made of two linear strands held together in opposite direction through chemical bonds, and which has become twisted into a helix.

A twisted structure made of two helices similar in shape to a twisted ladder.
